    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tteokbokki is a Korean street food snack made primarily of chewy rice cakes and fiery, funky gochujang chili paste. 
        In Lonely Planet's The World's Best Spicy Food, the cakes are tossed with slices of fried eomuk fish cake, cabbage, 
        scallions, and garlic. Salty anchovy stock bolsters the gochujang and gochugaru chili flakes add even more heat. 
        The final assemblage is unabashedly spicy, but impossible to put down. Eat it between sips of cold, cheap beer for the 
        perfect Friday night meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>450g rice cakes</li>
        <li>100g fish cakes</li>
        <li>2tbsp gochugaru</li>
        <li>2tbsp gochujang</li>
        <li>3tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups water or beef stock</li>
        <li>green onion</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong> Pour the beef stock or water into a medium-sized pan. Add the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Make sure the paste is dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium.</li>
        <li><strong>For the rice cakes:</strong> Add the rice cakes and boil them until soft (roughly 7 to 10 minutes). Reduce to a simmer to thicken the sauce. Keep stirring to prevent the rice cakes from burning at the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the fish cakes and green onions. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with additional sugar and soy sauce, bearing in mind that the gochujang itself is spicy. Add the sesame oil, stir through and dish out into bowls. Top with sesame seeds if desired.</li>
    </ol>
